          <p>Hey guys! I'm Maha Akkina, and I am so excited to serve as your President for Skin for Skin! I'm currently a Senior at Independence High School and am striving to enter the medical field, preferably through Pediatrics and Dermatology! I love to draw, cook, read, and crochet in my free time, and am so excited to start this journey! I hope that together we can make a meaningful impact in not only North Texas, but other areas as well, and hopefully help alleviate the struggle for some of our friends out there who deal with skin disease :).</p>
